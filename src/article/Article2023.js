            <p className='text-white mb-5 lg:w-10/12 md:w-96 w-72 text-justify'>However, migrating from being an employee to an employer should be gradual. I will advise you to gather enough money, education (financial education), experience, materials and confidence needed before you switch. It's also true that not all businesses need a lot of experience and money to start, you will learn and acquire more funds as you progress. Don't allow anything to hold you back if you're convinced and determined. Your readiness, having a sound business idea and proper planning, all crowned with prayer are more important than the capital for a business to be successful. Even having a sound idea with proper planning will attract the right funding.

            1. It's about you identifying a problem, finding a solution, money will always follow - Kayode Quadri.

            2. Also have a cushion . That is something to fall *forward to (don't fall back, but fall forward). Having a good reserve will give you the confidence when starting your new adventure - the entrepreneurship journey. Expect the ups and downs. You should know the level of your failure tolerance and outline your recovery plans.
            </p>
             <p className='text-white -mb-3 lg:w-10/12 md:w-96 w-72 text-sm text-justify'>
             3. If you know you don't have what it takes to become a full time entrepreneur now, you can start by investing in real estate, buying halal stocks, mutual funds, and investing in businesses you understand which someone else can manage for you while you still keep your beloved job. What is bad is relying solely on income from a job (your physical effort), it's highly risky. "An unreliable money is the money that stops when you stop working''  - Oladitan Saliu. Don't wait until your retirement approaches before you start thinking about what to retire *into.
             </p>

             <p className='text-white mb-2 lg:w-10/12 md:w-96 w-72 text-sm text-justify'>
            4. Also, before going into entrepreneurship, seek professional counsel, don't act blindly so that you won't lose everything at the end. Do your SWOT analysis... know your (STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES and THREATS). That (good) passion (of yours) can be turned into profit - Ust. Taofeeq. Especially, meet people who are already successful in the domain you want to venture into for advice before you start. Have good mentors and role models. Don't be shy to approach people for advice - many people are ready to render you a helping hand. But be careful with whom you share your ideas.

            5. The Pareto Principle states that 20 percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results. Try to do as many things as possible rightly in your business for a favourable outcome. Don't be selfish, form partnership with brighter minds if you need to. As the saying goes "if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together". Have a cooperation mindset and not the usual and destructive competition mindset. But, choose your partners wisely.

        7. All of us, we are products of our knowledge and experience. That's what makes whatever decision we take - Kayode Quadri. So what are you putting into your head and who are you listening to? We need to do a mindset engineering, changing the mindset of the Muslims - Ustadh Taofeeq. Not everything is haram, you can do legitimate business and make halal money. If a muslim can't offer what you want, doing business with a non-muslim is not forbidden if it won't impact your religion negatively.
        </p>
        <p className='text-white mb-2 lg:w-10/12 md:w-96 w-72 text-sm text-justify'>
        8. You can determine your *possible financial future by examining two things. First, what are you spending your time on? Second, what are you spending a higher portion of your money on - (liabilities or assets)?. Simply put, liabilities take money away from your pocket and can cause you to lose more money. While an asset is something you are spending on/investing in now which will later put money in your pocket and allows you to make more money now or in the future.

        9. To be honest, the world we live in now is driven by technology, use it to your advantage. While many people are seriously busy wasting their time online, you can turn it into a money-making platform for yourself. "Change is inevitable, if you stick to the old system, you and your business will become history" - Oladitan Saliu.
